## 🎬 PRODUCTION SHORTCUTS

### Fast-Paced Editing Tips

1. **Section Transitions:** Use quick 0.2s fades between sections
2. **Circle Appearance:** All circles fade in over 0.25s (faster than original)
3. **No Labels Needed:** Let the voiceover explain each field—no text labels required
4. **Preview Zooms:** When calling out preview, do a subtle 105% zoom on phone (0.3s)
5. **Toggle Demo:** Spend full 3 seconds showing the "I agree" vs "No" flow

### Cursor Movement Strategy

- **Smooth but quick** movements between fields
- **Pause 0.5s** on each field before typing
- **Type at 60 characters/second** (faster than normal for demo effect)
- **Check boxes with single click** (no hover delay)

## 📝 CONDENSED SCRIPT (For Teleprompter)

```
Creating a WhatsApp contest? Let me show you how easy it is. 
Just six collapsible sections—that's it!

First, expand the Contest section. Give it a name, description, 
and set your dates. Simple! Notice the WhatsApp preview on the 
right—it updates in real-time.

Next, PDPA compliance. Paste your privacy policy link here. 
Then customize three messages: the consent request, the welcome 
when they agree, and the opt-out if they decline. See it here—
this is exactly what participants receive on WhatsApp.

Write a warm welcome message. This greets participants after 
they agree. You can personalize it with their name using brackets. 
It appears right here in the chat flow.

Now set your requirements. Add instructions, check the boxes—
require NRIC, require receipt, and set a minimum purchase amount 
like 98 ringgit here. Watch the preview—participants see your 
instructions and respond with their details.

This is the receipt photo guide. Tell participants exactly how 
to take a clear photo: flat surface, good lighting, entire receipt 
visible. Pro tip: add a GIF or image URL showing a good example. 
This dramatically reduces rejected submissions. Your detailed 
instructions appear here, step-by-step.

Finally, configure your response messages. Write a success message 
showing what the AI detected—invoice number, store name, product, 
amount—all automatically verified! And a failure message if 
something goes wrong. Here's the success flow—AI processes the 
receipt and confirms all details.

That's it! Review everything one more time using the live preview, 
then click Create Contest. Your automated WhatsApp contest is now 
live—no coding required!
```
